          <p>Hi! I'm Shaqib Habib, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
          <p>Through two years in the tech industry working in event planning, community operations, and advertising, I have developed a passion for project management and problem-solving, leading me to pursue a career in full-stack web development. I am committed to developing and creating strategic projects and enjoy exploring new ideas and programming languages. Having worked in a wide variety of environments, I’ve shown initiative and functioned cross-collaboratively to successfully achieve project goals while remaining calm under high-pressure deadlines and urgent client requests. Thorough attention to detail is crucial in identifying and analyzing to break down the big picture vision into manageable steps. Currently, my goal is to work as a web developer for an organization I’m passionate about in an environment that fosters growth, development, and encourages creative freedom.</p>
