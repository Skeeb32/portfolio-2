                  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

                  <p>I understand the creation of a new website can be a bit daunting. Where do I start? What technologies should I use? How can I make my website run smoothly and bug-free? How can I optimize it for my target audience?</p>

                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>Basic HTML and CSS are fundamental to any web site or web app on the internet. Being able to create layouts using CSS is the next progression on your journey to a full stack web developer. We learned about CSS resets, box model layout, display types, and positioning. As we progressed into more advanced UI layout techniques were taught about the Flexible Box Module also known as flexbox. There are many ways to layout a page in CSS but flexbox is one of the most powerful and simple ways to do it. By the end of it all, we created a fully functional website from several design files.</p>

                        <h3>React</h3>
                        <p>React is one of the most popular UI libraries today, and in terms of Single Page Applications many (including the React team) tend to think of the library as the “V” in MVC. That is, the View layer of the Model, View, Controller paradigm. React is a pattern, a mindset, that will help developers that use it, build small, reusable pieces of UI that can be easily put together to make a large scale application. We used JavaScript modules to export and import components, used props and applied it to data flows in a React applicaton, and we used advance styling techniques to make a website look more poslished.

                        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                        <p>I love to look at JavaScript through this analogy. Think of a web page as a house. You need someone to architect and get in the structure of your house, someone to add in the design, and someone to add in the electricity to power the house. If you were to think about HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the three necessary building blocks, for a web page, HTML could be the architecture/layout of what your house should be, CSS is the design/style of your house and JavaScript powers the electrical interactions that our house needs to have in order to be functional!</p>

                             <p> In this project I created a Lambda Newspaper by creating components that make up the newspaper's home page. I started off by doing this with static data, then I requested data from a server to create dynamic components. We explored the DOM, created event listeners, and converted a NodeList into an Array.</p>

                            <p>In this project I accessed the GitHub API and built a social card based on the data we get back. The goal was to create a component based on the data we get when we send a GET request to the GitHub API. The reqest we were given back was an list of objects. We then traced the objets and created a link from the API to the page.</p>

We built a chef portfolio where chef's can showcase their work and be hireable. In this project, we created a website based of HTML and CSS.</p>
